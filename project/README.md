#AP Physics Equations List Website
####Video Demonstration: https://youtu.be/kxTLz6rxCas
####Description:    A List of all of the equations used in the AP Physics Curriculum since I always had a hard time finding them myself.
    "index.html" is my home page, which contains the title and description of the website, with a picture of Einstein floating up. Centering the text and the bottom yellow footer was a pain, but I ended up getting it to work along side Einstein. The Home Page was actually the last part of the project I worked on.

    "physics1.html", contains a header with a link to all the variables used in AP Physics. It lists down AP Physics 1 equations in tables each sorted by Chapter.

    "physics2.html" is the same deal as the first one except it has all of the Lessons and Equations from AP Physics 2. Still haveing the link to the variables.

    "contents.html" is about taking the Exam itself, listing details about each section and how each Lesson is weighted. It took more time than I'd like to admit in order to create tables inside of tables and make them look nice.

    "styles.css" contains all the code to make my website look nice. It is, however, completely unorganized, because of the many frustrating times I had to go back and forth in order to get the correct result, sorry. It is also where most of my collective struggle went into, since each page connected back to it, I revisited it alot.

    "scriptures.js" is my javascript code. There honestly isn't much to look at here. All of the script was solely for the Search Bar: showing and hiding the dropdown of the possible searches, and filtering the options as you type. I didn't have to include much scripts, which was surprising.

    The First Obstacle was writing each and every equation listed by Collegeboard for AP Physics, I had to use "<math>" in order to accurately write fractions and variables. It took me 8 hours in total to get down every equation and make sure I'm naming them correctly. Translating equations into html wasn't difficult by any means, it was just sooooo time consuming. Another Obstacle was the navigation bar which didn't work sometimes, and had to go through a lot of tabs inorder to figure it out, I ended up learning a lot about .css and .html because of it, so I regret the time I spent on it a little bit less. Basically in every page, I had to go through a lot of times because they never worked the first time.

    One of the major element I had to work around was the Search Bar, originally it had a submit button and you typed stuff and and hit it. But it ended up being more of a dropdown search bar, which to be honest, I like more, because it shows the user the options, and the user can just hit the corresponding button in the dropdown instead of typing, giving them more options.

    One thing I hated about the process of creating the website was having it look good for both computer and mobile, I had tried to this sort of thing before with past projects, but they always had mixed results, and I didn't pay as much attention to that element as other things. However this time, I wanted to have it show up good for both devices, which I regret not showing in the Youtube Video, because I ran out of time.

    Overall, this assignment was honestly the funnest assignment throughout this Course, becuase it gave me so much freedom. Of course, with so much freedom, I had less help, and had to struggle the most of it on my own, but in the process I learned much more about website design, which before, when I saw the "Inspect" tab, I always saw it as nonsense, but after this project, I see it as less of nonsense as before. Thanks CS50 People, I enjoyed this course more than I believed I could, have a Great Day!!!
